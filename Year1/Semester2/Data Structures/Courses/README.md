# Courses â€“ Data Structures Theory

This section contains in-depth **theoretical explanations** of core data structures. Each topic includes:

- Motivation: Why this structure exists and where it's used
- Core operations and behaviors
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Pseudocode and sometimes real code snippets
- Comparisons with other structures

The goal is to provide a solid theoretical foundation that complements practical implementations from the [Labs](../Labs) section and exercises in the [Seminars](../Seminars) section.

## Writing Conventions

Each file will generally follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Motivation
Short description of the problem this structure solves.

## Core Operations
- insert()
- delete()
- search()
- ...

## Time Complexities
| Operation | Best | Average | Worst |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| Insert    | O(1) | O(1)    | O(n)  |
| ...

## Pseudocode
```pseudo
function insert(x):
    ...
