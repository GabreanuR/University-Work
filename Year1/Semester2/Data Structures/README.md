 # Data Structures - Year 1 - Semester 2

This folder contains all resources, assignments, projects, notes, and other materials related to the **Data Structures** course in **Year 1 - Semester 2** of my Computer Science studies at the University of Bucharest.

## Course Overview

- **Professorr**: Istrate Gabriel
- **Credits**: 5
- **Description**: C++

## Folder Overview

### `Courses/`
- Markdown notes for each data structure
- Includes motivation, use cases, pseudocode, key operations, and time complexities
- Will also include proofs and comparisons later

### `Labs/`
- Hands-on implementations of data structures in C++
- Organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Stacks, Trees)
- Includes sample problems and edge case handling

### `Seminars/`
- Theoretical exercises from university seminar sessions
- Focused on understanding the behavior, limits, and properties of data structures
- Often asked in exams or technical interviews

### `Other/`
- Exam models
- Work of other students

## ✅ Topics Covered (Work in Progress)

- Arrays & Vectors
- Stacks & Queues
- Heaps (Min, Max)
- Linked Lists, Skip Lists
- Hash Tables & Bloom Filters
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

- Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal, Prim)
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge, Quick, Count, Heap, etc.)
- Complexity Classes

## Purpose

This repo is designed to serve as:
- A study guide for university courses and exams
- A reference point for revisiting data structures
- A preparation hub for coding interviews (internships, jobs)

## 🛠Technologies
